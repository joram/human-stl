# Human Photo to STL
this is based heavily on the works of two other projects:
- [openpose]()
- [pifuhd]()

## Openpose
Openpose is a library that can detect human poses in images and videos.

## PIFuHD
PIFuHD is a library that can generate 3D models from 2D images.

## Usage
Together, these two libraries can be used to generate 3D models from 2D images of humans.
